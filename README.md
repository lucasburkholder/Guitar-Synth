# Guitar-Synth
A simple guitar pluck synthesizer, using improvements on the Karplus-Strong plucked string synthesis algorithm researched by Steven Sanders and Ron Weiss (https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~ronw/dsp/).

The prototype code can be found in the MATLAB directory, and includes some of Sanders' and Weiss' original code.
